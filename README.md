# honeypot

A simple little honey pot to get request data (IP addresses, timestamps, user-agent strings, requested URIs, etc) from people that click a link.

## Use case

1. Set it up;
2. Send hand-crafted links to people you want to gather info on;
3. Look inside the `dumps/` folder for dumps of all data available to PHP.
